    "text" : "ABSTRACT\nReinforcement Learning (RL) following Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) has become the standard paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the mechanism by which RL contributes to reasoning capabilitieswhether it incentivizes the synthesis of new skills or merely amplifies existing behaviors-remains a subject of intense debate. In this work, we investigate this question through the lens of Complementary Reasoning , a complex task that requires integrating internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. Using a controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, we strictly decouple this ability into two atomic skills: Parametric Reasoning (relying on internal knowledge encoded in model parameters) and Contextual Reasoning (depending on novel information provided in the context window). To rigorously assess capability boundaries, we evaluate generalization across three distinct levels of difficulty: I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings . We find that while SFT is sufficient for in-distribution performance, it struggles with out-of-distribution generalization, particularly in Zero-shot settings where relational combinations are novel. Crucially, we identify the SFT Generalization Paradox : Models supervised solely on the composite task achieve near-perfect in-distribution accuracy (90%)",

In real-world scenarios, systems often encounter 'missing link' failures: for example, in Figure 1(a), a RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG) system might retrieve a document about a 'Chief Editor', but fail to link it to the chief editor's 'business partner' stored in the model's parametric memory. We define this capability as Complementary Reasoning (COMP) : the ability to seamlessly bridge internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. For example, answering 'What is the occupation of the business partner of Global View's new Chief Editor? ' requires the model to seamlessly integrate the external information ( e.g., Amina Khan is the Chief...) with the internal knowledge ( e.g., Ben Carter is a business partner...). While human intelligence intuitively performs this composition-seamlessly leveraging known facts alongside new context-LLMs often struggle to generalize when required",

    "text" : "6.3 CASE STUDY\nIn contrast, SFTMEM+CTX → RLCOMP demonstrates a fundamental shift in knowledge flow utilization. The error distribution flips significantly: 70% of errors are from MEM, and the average error position occurs much later (71.8%), mostly at the final hop. This indicates that RL effectively optimizes the reasoning path through the knowledge flow . We hypothesize that the vulnerability at the last step is attributed to data sparsity in complementary reasoning tasks. Since our data ( i.e., human biographies) relies on 'character' entities as bridges, the final relation connecting to the answer (which can be either a character or a keyword) appears less frequently in the training distribution compared to the intermediate bridging relations.",

    "text" : "7 CONCLUSIONS\nWhile current LLMs are proficient in multi-hop reasoning with either parametric or contextual knowledge, they struggle to handle questions that require the integration of both knowledge sources. In this paper, we study how LLMs can generalize to Complementary Reasoning with post-training strategies ( i.e., SFT and RL). We conduct strictly controlled experiments with our synthetic human biographies based on a relational knowledge graph, constructing QA pairs for atomic skills ( i.e., Parametric and Contextual Reasoning) and the compound skill ( i.e., Complementary Reasoning). We also split the dataset into different levels of generalization difficulties I.I.D., Composition and Zero-shot. Based on this, we study the effect of training strategies and find that only by firstly SFT with sufficient atomic skills can LLMs generalize via RL. This finding suggests a scalable path for training reasoning LLMs: focusing on teaching the model sufficient fundamental atomic skills via SFT, and then leveraging RL for generalization to O.O.D. complex tasks.",

While evaluated on the Qwen family, our decomposition of reasoning into atomic priors suggests these findings are likely architecture-agnostic. 2) As we investigate from the sample efficiency, the pass@k performance, the training dynamic, the embedding distributions and case study, it is still difficult to find the mechanisms that enable the SFTMEM+CTX model to outperform. Future work should investigate the mechanistic interpretability of how RL circuits recruit atomic attention heads. 3) While our study relies on synthetic biographies, this was a necessary design choice to strictly enforce the boundary between Parametric (known) and Contextual (new) information-a boundary that is impossible to guarantee in web-scale corpora due to pre-training contamination. Future work should validate these findings on controlled splits of real-time benchmarks ( e.g., news QA) where the 'new' information is strictly dated post-training. Moreover, future work",

For each relation, we adopt an LLM to construct and validate three natural language templates. We adopt heuristic rules to constrain the tailed entity of the relation ( e.g., birthday should be a date). Table 3 shows the relations and templates.\nFor QA pairs construction, after sampling the relation paths/combinations, we adopt GPT-4o to generate question templates.

    "text" : "B DETAILS OF SFT TRAINING BASELINES\nAs discussed in Section 4.1, we are able to synthesize as much data as needed. However, in realworld scenarios, while LLMs can easily handle either Parametric or Contextual Reasoning, probably through post-training with sufficient data, they struggles in Complementary Reasoning task, where it is hard to collect ample data. We show in Table 1a that Complementary Reasoning is data-hungry and most difficult compared to parametric and contextual reasoning. Here we show empirical results training with SFT and evaluating on the corresponding testing set in Table 6.\nIt further shows that Contextual Reasoning is the easiest. While LLMs learns to adopt new knowledge during SFT training, they manage to handle most of the unseen knowledge in the context window. We hypothesize that this ability is essential for further generalization to new reasoning patterns. Moreover, SFT training involving parametric knowledge would be hard to generalize on Zero-shot settings. Both parametric and complementary reasoning, while performing well on I.I.D. setting, drop significantly on Composition and almost fail on Zero-shot setting.",

We observe consistent behaviors that strongly support the effectiveness of our proposed recipe.\nAs shown by the blue lines, SFTMEM+CTX leads to substantial performance jumps after RLCOMP . This improvement is particularly pronounced in the Zero-shot setting, indicating that the model with sufficient atomic skills successfully generalizes the reasoning capabilities acquired during RL. In contrast, SFTCOMP (orange dashed line), while starting with decent performance, exhibits limited growth after RL training (orange solid line).

In addition, comparing SFTMEM+CTX with SFTMEM+CTX → RLMEM+CTX , we find that RL with atomic skills may not be beneficial to composite tasks. Note that for MEM and COMP data, every test sample in COMP would be either Composition or Zero-shot level (these two baselines have never seen any COMP data during training.

Furthermore, the setting itself is not as realistic-it is not trivial to obtain ample composite (COMP) data encompassing both MEM and CTX skills. Also, it is difficult to mix COMP data to SFT training with all atomic skills. However, our SFTMEM+CTX → RLCOMP assumes a common post-training practice with an initial SFT and a following RL stage.

    "text" : "E.2 THE IMPACT OF TRAINING LOSS FOR RL GENERALIZATION\nWeinvestigate a critical question regarding the interplay between Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL): Does the degree of SFT convergence dictate the model's potential for RL-based generalization? Specifically, we aim to determine if a 'grokking-like' phenomenon exists-where continuous optimization of SFT loss, even after apparent metric saturation, further unlocks the model's reasoning capabilities during the RL stage. Also, we study at which checkpoint ( i.e., training loss) may the model emerge the ability of generalization. We take four intermediate checkpoints of SFTMEM+CTX to further conduct RLCOMP and evaluate the performance on three levels of generalization.\nFigure 10 illustrates the performance trajectories across SFT checkpoints (1k to 4k steps), revealing three distinct phases of capability emergence:",

    "text" : "E.2 THE IMPACT OF TRAINING LOSS FOR RL GENERALIZATION\n- Insufficient Representation. At the early stage ( i.e., 1k steps, Training Loss ≈ 0 . 44 ), the model has not yet internalized the necessary reasoning patterns. Consequently, it fails to generalize effectively during the RL stage, resulting in suboptimal performance across all metrics (e.g., Zero-shot accuracy is significantly lower compared to later stages).\n- Emergence of Capabilities. As the SFT loss decreases to approximately 0 . 16 ( i.e., 2k steps), we observe a sharp 'phase transition' in downstream RL performance. While the base SFT model's direct performance (dashed lines) shows only moderate improvements, its latent potential for RL adaptation increases dramatically. This suggests that the critical structures required for reasoning generalization are established during this interval.",

Interestingly, further extending training to 4k steps-where the model nearly memorizes the training data (Loss ≈ 0 . 0004 )-does not yield further significant gains, nor does it lead to performance degradation. This indicates that while 'grokking' (delayed generalization) effectively occurs between 1k and 3k steps, the benefit saturates once the loss drops below a certain threshold ( < 0 . 05 ). The model becomes robust, maintaining its high plasticity for RL even when deeply fitted to the SFT distribution.\nIn conclusion, minimizing SFT loss is crucial up to a point . The generalization capability for RL does not scale infinitely with lower loss but requires a sufficient 'incubation' period (up to 3k steps in our setting) to fully emerge.",

Table 8 presents the entropy metrics across I.I.D., Compositional, and Zero-shot subsets.\nUncertainty is correlated with SFT convergence, not necessarily RL potential. We first address whether high uncertainty is a prerequisite for effective RL exploration. Comparing the SFTMEM+CTX checkpoints, the uncertainty drops significantly from 3k steps ( 12 . 92 ) to 4k steps ( 7 . 13 ) as the loss minimizes. Despite this lower starting entropy, we previously observed that the 4k-step model sustains high performance after RL. This indicates that a 'calibrated' and confident SFT model (lower entropy) does not hinder subsequent RL generalization.\n\nTable 8: Analysis of model uncertainty (measured by average entropy × 100 ) across different training settings.

    "text" : "E.4 MODEL UNCERTAINTY\nTask Difficulty Indicator. Consistently across all settings, the uncertainty is highest in the Zeroshot subset (e.g., 12 . 96 for 10% SFT(G3)). This aligns with intuition, as the model exhibits lower confidence on unseen distributions.\nSFTMEM+CTX Facilitates Efficient RL Adaptation. A key insight emerges when comparing the post-RL behaviors. In the 30% data setting, 30% SFTCOMP ( 7 . 18 ) and SFTMEM+CTX ( 7 . 13 ) start at remarkably similar uncertainty levels. However, after applying identical RL training, SFTCOMP → RLCOMP shows minimal entropy reduction ( 7 . 18 → 6 . 11 ), suggesting the model struggles to find a more optimal, confident policy. In contrast, our recipe SFTMEM+CTX → RLCOMP achieves a drastic reduction in uncertainty ( 7 . 13 → 2 . 90 ). This demonstrates that the model with sufficient atomic skills does not merely provide 'randomness' for exploration; rather, it structures the latent space (see Figure 11) in a way that allows RL to efficiently converge to a high-confidence, correct solution.",
