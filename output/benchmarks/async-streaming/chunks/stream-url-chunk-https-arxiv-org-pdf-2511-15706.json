    "text" : "Abstract\nDense feature matching aims to estimate all correspondences between two images of a 3D scene and has recently been established as the gold-standard due to its high accuracy and robustness. However, existing dense matchers still fail or perform poorly for many hard real-world scenarios, and high-precision models are often slow, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we attack these weaknesses on a wide front through a series of systematic improvements that together yield a significantly better model. In particular, we construct a novel matching architecture and loss, which, combined with a curated diverse training distribution, enables our model to solve many complex matching tasks. We further make training faster through a decoupled two-stage matching-then-refinement pipeline, and at the same time, significantly reduce refinement memory usage through a custom CUDA kernel. Finally, we leverage the recent DINOv3 foundation model along with multiple other insights to make the model more robust and unbiased. In our extensive set of experiments we show that the resulting novel matcher sets a new state-of-the-art, being significantly more accurate than its predecessors.

Introduction\nDense matching is the task of matching every pixel of image I A ∈ R H A × W A × 3 , with image I B ∈ R H B × W B × 3 in terms of a warp W A ↦→ B ∈ R H A × W A × 2 and a confidence mask p A ↦→ B ∈ [0 , 1] H A × W A × 1 . In dense feature matching, the assumption is that the pixels in both images are observations of 3D points from the same scene . In this case, for a perfect matcher, the confidence p A ↦→ B is 1 for pixels corresponding to a 3D point in the scene that is observable from both views, i.e., that are co-visible, and 0 for occluded pixels.\nFeature matching is a fundamental task in Computer Vision, as many downstream tasks, e.g., visual localization [29, 34, 42] and 3D reconstruction [19, 20, 25, 36, 38],\nFigure 1.

Traditionally, these methods relied on sparse matches established purely through descriptor similarity. In the last couple of years, these detector-descriptor methods have been gradually replaced by learning-based matchers that consider pairs of images when establishing the correspondences, allowing the networks to not only consider visual similarly but also the spatial context.\nThis development in feature matching has been driven by the introduction of several challenging benchmarks, such as MegaDepth-1500 [22, 41], ScanNet-1500 [9, 33], WxBS [27] and the recurring Image Matching Challenge at CVPR [15]. These benchmarks are currently dominated by detector-free methods, such as dense feature matchers [11] and feed-forward reconstruction models [47].\nOne noteable dense matcher is RoMa [12], which has proven robust to extreme photometric changes, including different modalities, due to using features from a frozen foundation model for the matching instead of learning features from scratch.

In contrast, LoFTR [41] takes a detector-free approach by matching through attention on learned features, resulting in a semi-dense matching where even non-salient points can be matched. In DKM[11], the matching is performed on a pyramid of feature maps, enabling pixel-dense matches. In a follow-up work, RoMa [12] further improves on this method by using a frozen foundation model to encode the coarse matching features, making it significantly more robust to extreme appearance changes.

Like the matcher, we use a learning rate of 4 · 10 -4 .\nArchitecture: As the matcher, in contrast to RoMa where the matcher predicts at stride 14, predicts at stride 4, there is only a need to refine at strides equal or smaller. We thus construct three refiners at strides { 4 , 2 , 1 } respectively. These follow a similar architecture as in RoMa [12] with some efficiency improvements. First, we find that the local correlation implementation used in RoMa uses a large amount of memory, especially at high resolution. To remedy this we write a custom CUDA kernel as a PyTorch extension, which significantly reduces the memory consumption (cf. Table 8). We further change all channel dimensions to be powers of two, which further boosts performance. Further details about the refiners is given in the appendix.",

At first this seemed like a data issue, but through plotting this bias over the course of training we found that it appears almost random, see Figure 6a. As the bias is seemingly uncorrelated over the course of training, a simple way to fix it is to simply use an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 1 . We found a decay factor of α = 0 . 999 to work well empirically. After applying this remedy, we find that the bias in both orientations is substantially diminished, see Figure 6b.\nRefinement Loss: We train the refiners using a combination of three losses.

In particular, we sample 1024 keypoints using ALIKED [54] and use as query points in the tracking head. We try different confidence and covisibility thresholds. We settle for 0 . 1 for both.\nUFM: We follow the same sampling as for RoMa v2 and RoMa, using bidirectional warps and balanced sampling. However, as UFM only supports a fixed resolution of H = 420 × W = 560 we do not use upsampling.",

Bias In AerialMegaDepth\nWe observe that RoMa v2 sometimes produces estimates overlaps in textureless sky regions, as demonstrated in Figure 13 We believe that this is due to AerialMegaDepth sometimes propagating depths from the mesh to sky pixels, as illustrated in Figure 14.\nFigure 13. Visualization of RoMa v2 warp. Note that the model puts some confidence erroneously in sky pixels (see top-left). This may be due to bias stemming from AerialMegaDepth.\nFigure 14. Spurious depth estimates in AerialMegaDepth. Depth from the scene leaks into the sky, causing some skypixels to be multi-view consistent. This possibly leaks into the warp estimate of RoMa v2.",
