    "text" : "Abstract\nWe introduce Docling , an easy-to-use, self-contained, MITlicensed, open-source toolkit for document conversion, that can parse several types of popular document formats into a unified, richly structured representation. It is powered by state-of-the-art specialized AI models for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table structure recognition (TableFormer), and runs efficiently on commodity hardware in a small resource budget. Docling is released as a Python package and can be used as a Python API or as a CLI tool. Docling's modular architecture and efficient document representation make it easy to implement extensions, new features, models, and customizations. Docling has been already integrated in other popular open-source frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, spaCy), making it a natural fit for the processing of documents and the development of high-end applications. The open-source community has fully engaged in using, promoting, and developing for Docling, which gathered 10k stars on GitHub in less than a month and was reported as the No. 1 trending repository in GitHub worldwide in November 2024.",

With the advent of LLMs and popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich content embedded in PDFs, Office documents, and scanned document images has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful document understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial software, SaaS offerings on hyperscalers (Auer et al. 2022) and most recently, multimodal vision-language models. Typically, they incur a cost (e.g., for licensing or LLM inference) and cannot be run easily on local hardware. Meanwhile, only a handful of different open-source tools cover PDF, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, Images, or HTML conversion, leaving a significant feature and quality gap to proprietary solutions.\n* These authors contributed equally.\nCopyright © 2025, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Docling is designed as a simple, self-contained Python library with permissive MIT license, running entirely locally on commodity hardware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models. Since its launch in July 2024, Docling has attracted considerable attention in the AI developer community and ranks top on GitHub's monthly trending repositories with more than 10,000 stars at the time of writing. On October 16, 2024, Docling reached a major milestone with version 2, introducing several new features and concepts, which we outline in this updated technical report, along with details on its architecture, conversion speed benchmarks, and comparisons to other open-source assets.\nThe following list summarizes the features currently available on Docling:",

Among proprietary solutions, prominent examples include GPT-4o (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), and Gemini (Google). In the open-source domain, LLaVA-based models, such as LLaVA-next, are noteworthy. However, all generative AI-based models face two significant challenges. First, they are prone to hallucinations, i.e., their output may contain false information which is not present in the source document - a critical issue when faithful transcription of document content is required. Second, these models demand substantial computational resources, making the conversion process expensive. Consequently, VLM-based tools are typically offered as SaaS, with compute-intensive operations performed remotely in the cloud.",

Examples include Adobe Acrobat, Grobid, Marker, MinerU, Unstructured, and others. These solutions often rely on multiple specialized models, such as OCR, layout analysis, and table recognition models. Docling falls into this category, leveraging modular, task-specific models which recover document structures and features only. All text content is taken from the programmatic PDF or transcribed through OCR methods. This design ensures faithful conversion, without the risk of generating false content. However, it necessitates maintaining a diverse set of models for different document components, such as formulas or figures.\nWithin this category, Docling distinguishes itself through its permissive MIT license, allowing organizations to integrate Docling into their solutions without incurring licensing fees or adopting restrictive licenses (e.g., GPL).

Its architecture is derived from RT-DETR (Zhao et al. 2023) and re-trained on DocLayNet (Pfitzmann et al. 2022), our popular human-annotated dataset for document-layout analysis, among other proprietary datasets. For inference, our implementation relies on the Hugging Face transformers (Wolf et al. 2020) library and the Safetensors file format. All predicted bounding-box proposals for document elements are post-processed to remove overlapping proposals based on confidence and size, and then intersected with the text tokens in the PDF to group them into meaningful and complete units such as paragraphs, section titles, list items, captions, figures, or tables.",

It can predict the logical row and column structure of a given table based on an input image, and determine which table cells belong to column headers, row headers or the table body. Compared to earlier approaches, TableFormer handles many characteristics of tables like partial or no borderlines, empty cells, rows or columns, cell spans and hierarchy on both column-heading and row-heading level, tables with inconsistent indentation or alignment and other complexities. For inference, our implementation relies on PyTorch (Ansel et al. 2024). The PDF pipeline feeds all table objects detected in the layout analysis to the TableFormer model, by providing an image-crop of the table and the included text cells. TableFormer structure predictions are matched back to the PDF cells during a post-processing step, to avoid expensive re-transcription of the table image-crop, which also makes the TableFormer model language agnostic.",

The former provides a simple starting point, upon which any text-based chunking method may be applied (e.g., also drawing from the framework library), while the latter, which uses a swappable Docling chunker type, can be the more powerful one, as it can provide document-native RAG grounding via rich metadata such as the page number and the bounding box of the supporting context. For usage outside of these frameworks, users can still employ Docling chunkers to accelerate and simplify the development of their custom pipelines.

In the future, we plan to extend Docling with several additional models, such as a figure-classifier model, an equation-recognition model and a code-recognition model. This will help improve the quality of conversion for specific types of content, as well as augment extracted document metadata with additional information. Furthermore, we will focus on building an opensource quality evaluation framework for the tasks performed by Docling, such as layout analysis, table structure recognition, reading order detection, text transcription, etc. This will allow transparent quality comparisons based on publicly available benchmarks such as DP-Bench (Zhong 2020), OmnidDocBench(Ouyang et al. 2024) and others. Results will be published in a future update of this technical report.\nThe codebase of Docling is open for use under the MIT\nlicense agreement and its roadmap is outlined in the discussions section 1 of our GitHub repository. We encourage everyone to propose improvements and make contributions.",
